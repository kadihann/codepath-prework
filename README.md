# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Kadidiatou Hann

Time spent: 118 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I used the Slack pre-work support chat as the outside resourcde to aid in allowing me to complete the project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   One challenge I had to overcome while doing the project would have to be figuring out how to make all of the buttons turn off after the hints and sounds would be given to the player. Everything with the program and code itself looked fine after going over it multiple times, while also adding a couple things in order to see if I accidentally forgot to add a code. It was a lot of trial and error to the point where I was pressing the actual buttons themselves multiple times a day and just having that window open 24/7. I even attempted to do some online research in order to see what could be causing this small but very frustration problem to occur. Right as I feel as if I was making some form of progress, my laptop ended up dying and not being able to turn on. Which is when I found out that my laptop had gotten very severe liquid damage and would have to be taken to the apple repair warehouse where they would have to strip the entirety of the hardware. Specifically it would have to be the battery, motherboard, and all of the hardware components excluding the parts such as the keyboard, screen, and the touchpad. Meaning that it would take a minimum of about a week to get fixed, and so I had to take a couple days off of fixing the issue until we could come back on campus. Since this all occurred during the last couple days of spring break because students in on campus housing are not allowed to stay on campus during the break. So, the moment I was finally able to come back to my dorm, I rented a laptop out from the library while waiting for my laptop to get shipped to my dorm. After going over my already written and finished code for another couple times, and reaching out for help in the Slack pre-work support chat I had to make the tough and final decision of having to completely restart the code. It took me a few hours to completely finish, but when I did attempt to finally play the game, I noticed that the stop button would not turn back to the start button when pushed. But after going over the code, the mistake I made was accidentally forgetting to switch the add and remove methods in order for the stop button to disappear when pressed and the start button to appear. Which was an easy mistake to fix. After fixing it, the game was finally able to work as it was meant to, which is why I decided to include two more buttons for the player.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   	A question I have about web development is similar to the problem I encountered and it has to do with what happens when there is a bug or error in your code that you  can not seem to find. My main issue was the fact that I was not able to find the error that was made in the code, whether it be in the Javascript, HTML, and/or the CSS file. So, the question that comes to mind after having to personally experience a coding situation that caused me to restart completely from scratch, would have to be, is it more efficient sometimes to restart the whole program and code when there is an error that just cannot be caught? But when saying restart the program, I tend to mean not when an entire project is finished, it would instead be as you’re doing tests and debugging as you’re writing the program. As a follow up question, would it also be a good idea to save whatever project that is having a weird error that you are working on at the moment, but make another copy of it where it is being redone in order to see if you can catch the error the second time arounds. But you would still have the original project as a back up, in case no error was caught.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had more time and hours to work on the project, I would spend it adding more features and trying to find ways in seeing if it is possible in making the code much more efficient. With the features, I would include some of the optional ones that were given as examples in the Prework assignment, such as adding a timer that counts down, as well as increasing the speed of not only the lights turning on. But also decreasing the amount of time the player has in choosing the right button, and when a choice has not been made in the given allocated time, the player loses that round. I would also include an option where the players can play against others who do happen to be playing the game and having the winner be the one who can complete it at a faster time. I would try to make the code more efficient because I feel as if, and have learned from prior coding classes that your codes can always be looked back on and also be worked on in order to become a much more efficient program.
